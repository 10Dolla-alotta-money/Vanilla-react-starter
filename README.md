This is a template for setting up a Vanilla React project using Vite. Vite is a next-generation front-end tooling that provides a fast development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and a lightning-fast build process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository URL>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   If you're using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application running.

## Folder Structure

- `public`: Contains static assets that will be served as-is.
- `src`: Contains your React application code.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file where your React application is mounted.
- `main.jsx` or `App.jsx`: The main JavaScript file where your React application is initialized.
